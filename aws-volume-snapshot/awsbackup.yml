# This playbook requires an Ansible vault file.  In this case, it
# is stored in group_vars/all/vault.yml. Variables required are as follows:
# vault:
#   aws_secret_key: your_aws_secret_key
#   aws_access_key: your aws_access_key
#   region: your region
#
# This playbook also requies the "ec2_snapshot_facts.py" Ansible module in the
# library directory.  Props to wimnat:
